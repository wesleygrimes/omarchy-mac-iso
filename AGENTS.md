# Agents

This repo is **omarchy-mac-iso**: the Apple Silicon live USB and installer. It is not [omarchy-mac](https://github.com/omarchy-mac/omarchy-mac) (the installed desktop). Edits here do nothing on a running machine until they are copied onto a USB (or into an installed ESP).

`plans/apple-silicon-image.md` is the destination design. `README.md` is how to build and flash.

## What an agent is allowed to touch

- Live USB image, initramfs, installer TUI, GRUB embeds, and tests in this tree
- A plugged-in live USB via `sudo ./bin/omarchy-mac-iso-refresh-live` when the user asked to try a change on metal

Never:

- `mklabel`, `wipefs`, or partition-delete on a disk that already has Apple GPT types (APFS / iBoot / Recovery). The one exception is deleting GPT name `omarchy-install` (the temporary NVMe installer slice this repo created). Shrinking APFS happens in **macOS only**. Altering APFS from Linux can force a DFU restore
- Replace all of `m1n1/boot.bin`, or write `vendorfw/` / `asahi/`. j613 may patch **only** the existing DTB slot in `boot.bin`
- Put hostnames, USB brand names, or other machine-specific strings into shipped installer copy
- Open a PR unless the user asked for one
- Treat a successful `./test/unit` as a visual or metal proof

## Two artifacts, two initrds

The USB GPT is ESP (`OMARCHYISO`) + btrfs payload (`OMARCHYLIVE`, subvol `@`).

| Boot | ESP file | Initrd config |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Live installer | `initramfs-omarchy-usb.img` | `configs/usb-initcpio/mkinitcpio.conf` (overlay, `omarchy-usb-live`) |
| Installed disk | `initramfs-linux-asahi.img` (copied as `initramfs-omarchy-usb-root.img` or `EFI/omarchy/initramfs.img`) | `configs/usb-initcpio/mkinitcpio-install.conf` (wait + encrypt + Plymouth) |

`refresh-live` must rebuild **both** when the live USB is plugged in. Updating only the install initrd leaves live boot on a stale `initramfs-omarchy-usb.img`.

A full image is `sudo ./bin/omarchy-mac-iso-make --usb --rootfs` (pacstraps `omarchy-base.packages` plus sudo; 12GiB payload). That writes `payload.img`, `payload.img.zst` (Drive/SHARE), and ESP files; add `--disk-image` only when you want `omarchy-mac-usb.img` for `dd` onto a stick. The builder `pacman -Sy`s first and **fails** if a listed package is not in repos, not a remap, not a local tarball, and not in `packages-aarch64-skip`. Use refresh for installer scripts, GRUB cfg, and initrds on an existing stick. Refresh cannot grow the package set — that needs a rootfs rebuild. 1Password is not pre-installed; `omarchy-install-1password` after first boot sets the browser helper.

## Installer paths

`omarchy-mac-install` on the live overlay:

- **Wipe USB** / **free space** / **replace existing** — `mkfs.btrfs` then `tar` of used files from the overlay lowerdir (`/run/omarchy-root`). Not a `dd` of the payload
- **NVMe installer slice** — GPT name `omarchy-install` at the **tail** of the hole (macOS `scripts/macos/place-nvme-installer.sh` after UEFI-only). Live overlay from that slice; only free-space install is allowed there; first boot of the new root deletes **only** `omarchy-install` and grows. Never `parted rm` APFS / iBoot / Recovery
- **Clone** — still `dd` through the last partition; rewrite the clone btrfs UUID
- LUKS is offered on wipe, free-space, and replace. Same password as the desktop user. New LUKS volumes get label `OMARCHYROOT`
- Replace-existing looks for btrfs `OMARCHYROOT` **or** `crypto_LUKS` with that label / GPT name `root`. Asahi's own LUKS has neither — do not offer it
- Identity validation re-prompts. Full name and email are optional (git + XCompose). Before the copy, show a table of action, target, user, password stars, full name, email, hostname, encryption, then "Does this look right?"
- System ESP: **piggyback** through `custom.cfg` if some other OS owns GRUB. NVMe live uses a separate embed/config/marker; detect that state from `/omarchy-nvme-live`, require private sources, restore its saved pre-live `BOOTAA64.EFI`, and piggyback without replacing or parsing the owner's `grub.cfg`. **Own** only if the ESP had no pre-existing bootloader. Refuse the legacy `/omarchy-usb-live` NVMe layout until its installed EFI/GRUB owner is manually restored from backup. Never rewrite `vendorfw/` or `asahi/`. Never replace `m1n1/boot.bin` as a whole. The one m1n1 exception is the **j613 DTB slot**: `fdtoverlay` of `configs/m1n1/j613-dcp.dtbo` padded to the existing slot (`omarchy-mac-patch-j613-dcp`). Backup `boot.bin.bak-predcp`. Do not apply a DTB via GRUB `devicetree` (single-core boot). Do not write `/boot/extlinux/`
- macOS `gpt add` / `gpt label` are EPERM on the internal SSD. The placer uses `diskutil` placeholder + tail slice; the live TUI sets GPT name `omarchy-install`. Consume walks LUKS via dm `slaves`, not `lsblk -d PKNAME` (empty on `/dev/mapper/root`)
- M3 (j613) needs a kernel whose appledrm has V14_7 (`linux-asahi` >= 7.2). 7.1.6 stays on simpledrm. Unencrypted installs copy `initramfs-linux-asahi-plain.img` (no `encrypt` hook). Cmdline includes `appledrm.show_notch=1`. Hyprland `cursor.no_hardware_cursors = true` on t8122 until AGX exists. M3 Air Type-C PD is SPMI `sn201202x` (not I2C `tps6598x`); live/install initrds list `sn201202x?`. Kernel `.config` needs `CONFIG_TYPEC_SN201202X=m` or USB never leaves gadget mode. M3 Air Bluetooth (BCM4388, board `apple,dnieper`) OTP asks for AMKOR (`-a`) firmware; Asahi vendorfw often only has USI (`-u`). `omarchy-mac-bluetooth-firmware` aliases `-u`/`-m` to `-a` under `/usr/lib/firmware/brcm` and rebinds `hci_bcm4377`. Never write ESP `vendorfw/` to add the name.

Free space needs an unallocated GPT hole (from a macOS APFS shrink or Asahi UEFI-only). If the hole is already a partition, use replace-existing.

## Tests

```
./test/unit
```

That runs `bash -n`, installer greps, `test/partition`, and `test/esp-grub`. It does not boot a Mac.

Grep tests must fail if the behavior is removed. Do not match a string that still exists in a comment after the real call is gone.

## Metal

- Firmware for Wi-Fi comes from the **internal** ESP (`asahi` hook). The stick does not ship it
- U-Boot: cold power on (warm reboot often misses Type-C). `usb reset` until storage appears. Do not `saveenv`. A machine that already has Linux on NVMe must interrupt U-Boot or NVMe GRUB wins
- A Mac with no Asahi/m1n1 cannot boot this USB. iBoot will not load it until macOS has run the Asahi **UEFI-only** provision (`kmutil`). That step is out of this repo
- Live boot should stay quiet (`loglevel=0`, `systemd.show_status=0`, live GRUB masks Plymouth/ldconfig). Installed disks keep `quiet splash` and Plymouth. Confirm on the live stick after refresh, not only in git

## Style

- `#!/bin/bash` in this repo's scripts
- Full English names
- `[[ ]]` for strings/files, `(( ))` for numbers
- Installer `fail` exits; user validation uses `retry` and loops

## Working from another machine

Unit tests and editing this git tree work on any host (including x86 Omarchy). `refresh-live` and live/install `mkinitcpio` need a machine that already runs `linux-asahi` (dwc3-apple, host modules, vendor firmware layout). After a wipe of the Asahi box, keep a clone of this repo on a second computer so the branch still exists even if the NVMe does not.
